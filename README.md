# Wildfire-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Data
This project attempts to apply Time Series and Machine Learning models to a given set of variables in order to predict the possibility of a wildfire occurring. In doing so, the project first attempts to predict the Fire Risk Index, accounting for the data of environmental variables in the process, using an accurate time series model. After that, the project proceeds on its primary object of predicting the binary Fire Occurrence (1: Occurrence and 0: No Occurrence) variable by using the forecasted Index values along with classification models.
